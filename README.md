Do you want to protect yourself from Pegassus? use Pandora

Take a look at Wikipedia's Pegassus explanation

Pegasus is spyware developed by the Israeli cyberarms firm NSO Group that can be covertly installed on mobile phones
(and other devices) running most versions of iOS and Android. The 2021 Project Pegasus revelations suggest that the
current Pegasus software can exploit all recent iOS versions up to iOS 14.6. As of 2016, Pegasus was capable of
reading text messages, tracking calls, collecting passwords, location tracking, accessing the target device's
microphone and camera, and harvesting information from apps. The spyware is named after Pegasus, the winged horse
of Greek mythology. It is a Trojan horse computer virus that can be sent "flying through the air" to infect cell phones.

So my idea is to generate all messages (audio, text) on an external secure unconnected portable device, encrypt it,
send it to your insecure device and and then send it to the recipient.

If you use audio be carefull not to be near to your insecure mobile phone, because it will be meaningless to encrypt the
message if they can hear you anyway.
